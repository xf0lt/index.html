        <h2>Gaming Server</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>NMAP</li>
            <li>Gobuster</li>
            <li>ssh2john</li>
            <li>lxd-alpine-builder</li>            
        </ul>

        <p>
            The gaming server is an easy-level boot2root room, where the attacker is asked to find two flags namely user.txt and root.txt, without further ado let's get started. The first step I did was scan IP to see which ports were open using nmap, here I see two open ports, port 22 for ssh and port 80 for http, for more details, see the image below.
        </p>
        
        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/1.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" />
        <br /><br />
        
        <p>
            After finding an open port then I brute-forced the directory using Gobuster, this tool is built in from Kalilinux, if you don't have it, you can download it on GitHub. From the results I found, there were two interesting directories, namely the secret directory and the uploads directory. I didn't have to wait long. I immediately checked the directory.
        </p>
        
        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/2.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" /><br><br>
        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/3.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" /><br><br>
        
        <p>after I checked, it turned out that there was an RSA private key file, then I downloaded the code</p> <br>
        
        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/4.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" /><br><br>
        
        <p>before that I looked at the secret directory and found the rsa code, and now I find a file that contains a password wordlist, maybe? I also download it</p><p>Until here I am confused, because previously from the results I found from the scan results, I only found two ports, one of which was SSH, to do SSH of course we must have a user and I am here starting to look for who the user is. I finally found the username, namely John, by looking at the source code</p>

        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/5.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" /><br><br>

        <p>after I find the user, private key rsa, wordlist then what I do next is crack the private key rsa using ssh2john as below</p>

        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/6.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" /><br><br>

        <p>after you crack then you can brute force it with john like the picture below</p>

        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/7.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" /><br><br>        

        <p>
            once you find the password for the user you can ssh and get the user.txt</p>

        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/8.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" /><br><br>  

        <p>before we go to root make sure we know the uid first, here they use lxd, so I immediately searched for an lxd privilege tutorial on the internet, and I suggest you install lxd-alpine-builder first on github</p>

        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/9.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" /><br><br>    

        <p>after you clone lxd then your next step is to create a tar lxd file by typing the command in terminal
        <span>cd  lxd-alpine-builder</span>
             then 
           <span>./build-alpine</span></p>

        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/10.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" /><br><br>
        
        <p>after you create alpine, the next step is to send the file to John's machine, here I use python in the following way</p>

        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/11.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" /><br><br>

        <p>then I took the alpine file on John's machine by wget</p><br>

        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/12.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" /><br><br>

        <p>after that we check whether we have got it or not</p><br>

        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/13.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" /><br><br>

        <p>then I import</p>

        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/14.png" width="100%" height="100%" /><br><br>

        <p>safter we run the command above to be able to access root you can follow the steps below</p>

        <img src="/assets/images/ctf_image/15.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" /><br><br>        

        <p>and that's how i got root access. honestly to get lxd/lxc privileges is hard for me and i search many references on internet for this. and this time I learned something new about lxd/lxc exploits. I really enjoy this room. Thanks for reading, happy hacking!</p>
